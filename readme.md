The assignment was written as follows:

*This exercise has only one vague requirement as I want you to feel free to be as creative as you want to be.
The requirement is to build a web project that describes a car. What I am looking for from you is just the code of how you would structure the project and design it. If you can host the project code somewhere where you can just provide me access to it that would be best.  Just let me know if you have any questions.*


To make this fun, and since I'm not a mechanic, I decided to relate it to the car-related video game that I most recently enjoyed:  Forza Motorsport 7.   In Forza, the player is allowed to tune their vehicles in an attempt to get their best time around a given track.   The tune is allowed to affect many variables, such as maximum speed, accelleration, aerodynamics, cornering, traction, etc...

The UI presented isn't meant to be new.   For the post part, I took the UI controls in Forza and correlated them to their closest counterpart in the video game.  Integers remain integers, sliders remain sliders, etc...

So as to honestly be able to say that I played video games to get a second interview, I also field tested the cars contained in this project, and recorded the results in video format.   Each test run should link to the corresponding video that I then uploaded on to youtube.

Enjoy!
